            <h2>Text Tags</h2>

            <h3>Paragraph Tag - &lt;p></h3>
            <p>A paragraph tag is used to describe a paragraph.</p>

            <h3>Heading Tags - &lt;h1> ~ &lt;h6></h3>
            <p>The heading tags denote heading, where lower 
                        numbers are parent headings
                and higher numbers are subheadings.
            </p>

            <h3>Preformatted - &lt;pre></h3>
            <pre>Preformatted text allows us to intrepret text
                        based on format utilized in the defining
                                    documents.
            </pre>

            <h3>Code - &lt;code></h3>
            <code>Denotes a section of code.</code>

            <h3>Strong, Emphasis - &lt;strong>, &lt;em></h3>
            <p><strong>Strong</strong> and <em>emphasis</em> provide tools for providing
            emphasis to text written on a webpage. This tag both changes the underlying semantic
            meaning of the affected text, and is also levaraged by user-agent sheets to bold/italicize
            text.</p>

            <h2>List Tags</h2>

            <h3>Ordered List - &lt;ol></h3>
            <p>An ordered list is a list in which we are communicating that the order
                items are presented in is meaningful and that it should be preserved.
                Generally, user-agent stylesheets (browser default styles) will present
                order lists with numbers.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>First item</li>
                <li>Second item</li>
                <li>Third item</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Unordered List - &lt;ul></h3>
            <p>A list in which the elements of the list are ordered arbitrarily and
                the order has no significant meaning. Consequently, systems altering 
                the order is permissible.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>An item</li>
                <li>Another item</li>
                <li>Yet another item</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Description List &lt;dl></h3>
            <p>Description list is different in that each item has parts, some item
                and its description. The item is defined with &lt;dt> and its description
                is defined with &lt;dd>
            </p>
            <dl>
                <dt>Apple</dt>
                <dd>A sweet fruit that grows on a tree.</dd>

                <dt>Oranges</dt>
                <dd>In no way comparable to apples.</dd>
            </dl>
        
            <h3>List Item - &lt;li></h3>
            <p>List item tag is used as a <em>child</em> tag of an order list or Unordered
                list, representing an individual item in that list. Lists of type ol/ul should
                not have any direct children that are not list items.</p>

            <h3>Multi-media</h3>
            <h2>Image Tag &lt;img></h2>
            <p>Images are tags that can be used to load an image and display it as part
                of the webpage. It's important to understand that generally images are not a part
                of the website themselves, they are loaded as a resource. As such, we must
                always include the location of the resource that we intend to load. As such,
                we need a way to provide additional information to the tag.
            </p>
            <p>Additional information can be provided to tags using what are called 
                <em>attributes</em>. Attributes are names or key-value pairs that can be utilized
                by the tag. For instance, images leverage a <em>src</em> attribute to derive the location
                of the resource it needs to load.</p>

            <h2>Video Tag &lt;video></h2>
            <p>Video tag is used to provide HTML support for loading and viewing videos.</p>

            <h2>Audio Tag &lt;audio></h2>
            <p>Multimedia tag used to play audio files.</p>

            <h2>(Anchor tag) Hyper-reference &lt;a></h2>
            <p>Anchor tags provide a link to another location on a network (or the internet).
                Anchor tags form hyperlinks which are imperative to the purpose and meaning of HyperText.
                HyperText is the idea of immediate and unending information (in the form of text).

            <h2>Forms</h2>
            <p>Forms are used to gather data from the user of the page, using a variety
                of input types. These allow the user to interact with the page by setting
                values and then submitting these values to a server. Note: At the current
                time we have no server, so these values won't be submitted to any particular
                place. Later, we will have our own servers that we can submit requests to.
            </p>

            <h3>Form Tag - &lt;form></h3>
            <p>
                Form tag is a containing tag that holds a group of input fields and represents
                a group of related units of data that should be submitted together.
            </p>

            <h3>Input Tag - &lt;input></h3>
            <p>
                The input tag represents an input element. The type of input is defined using a
                type attribute. For instance, we might use the 'text' type to submit text fields,
                or the radio button to submit an option.
